    <P> Seriously, folks, we need to have this information sorted out into a 
      database before the Hunt begins. I will hunt you down if you do not 
      write me back. And honest answers only, please.
    </P>

    <P>Thank you,</P>

    <p><b>Instructions</b><br>
      Fill out the survey!  If you haven't done it before, this will
      create a user account for you.  You will be given a user name
      and password; use them to log in with the box in the side menu.
    </p>

    <p>You don't have to fill out every field, but please give us as much
      information as you're comfortable with sharing.  However, you have to
      fill out the fields marked <b>required</b> -- otherwise you'll just
      get an error.
    </p>

    <p>If you've already filled out the survey, you should have a user name
      and password.  Use those to log in, and then you will be able to update
      the information you provided.
    </p>

    <p>Don't hit <b>Send Survey</b> until you are happy with your
      answers!  That's what the <b>Update Survey</b> button is for.
      Check the bottom of this page to see the survey results that
      will be sent in when you hit the <b>Send</b> button.

	  instant</i>, how do they do it?  A few possibilities follow.

      <P><B>Meal Points</B>
	<br>
	Are you willing to donate 3 some points to the team so we can get some 
	snacklings and some food with which to bribe the judges?  What about flex 
        dollars, or Bartlett bucks?  (Hint to 
	first-years: You are not going to manage to use all of your meal points, 
	particularly during Spring Quarter).
      </p>
      <p>If yes, please enter your ISO number (the long number above the
	barcode on your UC ID) and what you're willing to give.
