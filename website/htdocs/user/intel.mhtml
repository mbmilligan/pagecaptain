    <h1>Intelligence Report</h1>

    <p>And <i>they</i> said, let there be a place, wherein all the juicy
      tibits we overhear in passing, all the scavish innuendo and layers of
      intrigue might be gathered and laid bare for the Spuds to see and
      examine with their own eyes, that they might better understand the
      cunning minds of the Judges, and so strike awe unto the same with their
      fierce understanding and wit.  And so the Turnip did make such a place,
      and whether the Rhizomes beheld it and found it good, or an utter waste
      of time better spent picking lint from their navels, only time will
      tell.
    </p>

    <p>If <i>you</i> have a contribution to the intelligence report, forward
      it to a Michael (or any one of the uber-tubers) and it'll make its way
      here.  Maybe.

    <h2>From the Rumor Mill</h2>

    <p>Paperwork has been filed, and money has changed hands, by the Judges to
      reserve a room in BSLC Thursday night.  They've got it until after 8 pm
      at least, because they had to pay for a night building manager.
    </p>

    <p>The Judges have mentioned making sure to hide the alcohol at the Quads
      party.  Meaning there will still be one, or else the Judges are messing
      with us in a slightly uncharacteristic way.  Usually they're either
      blatantly abusing us, or being hopelessly abstruse, after all.
    </p>

    <p>A little bird tells us that the Judges have been at least discussing a
      LotR item in the past few days.  Not surprising, but good to know.
