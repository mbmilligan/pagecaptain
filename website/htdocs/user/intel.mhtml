    <h1>Intelligence Report</h1>

    <p>And <i>they</i> said, let there be a place, wherein all the juicy
      tibits we overhear in passing, all the scavish innuendo and layers of
      intrigue might be gathered and laid bare for the Spuds to see and
      examine with their own eyes, that they might better understand the
      cunning minds of the Judges, and so strike awe unto the same with their
      fierce understanding and wit.  And so the Turnip did make such a place,
      and whether the Rhizomes beheld it and found it good, or an utter waste
      of time better spent picking lint from their navels, only time will
      tell.
    </p>

    <p>If <i>you</i> have a contribution to the intelligence report, forward
      it to a Michael (or any one of the uber-tubers) and it'll make its way
      here.  Maybe.

    <h2>Not exactly espionage</h2>

    <p>This email landed in my box today:</p>
	<qq><pre>Subject: not exactly spying, but good to know

I was on qb with judge Christian Kammerer.  Various obsessions of his:
-zoology.  He once posted on a Simpsons mailing list about the species
most like the tree lizards. He used to know the days when zoological
journals would come into the reg, and he'd go in and photocopy the
articles he liked.  Especially those on:
-intestinal parasites.  Oh, don't ask me. He likes all sorts of little
critters, but especially these. He at one point, in fact, wanted to
feature intestinal parasites in a:
-Comic book.  He loves the comic books.  Unrelated:
-Donuts.  He once hid a box of donuts in the rafters of a classroom to
keep them away from other quiz bowl people.

Don't know why any of this would matter, but I thought I'd share.
