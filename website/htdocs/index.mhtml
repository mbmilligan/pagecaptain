    <p>We had a meeting Sunday, and we therefore have some actual
      useful information for this site. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The T-shirt order is has been placed.  You can see the final design
	<a href="/tshirt.pdf">here</a> (black will be printed in gray on a
	maroon background).  Email 
	<a href="mailto:tbbuckle@cs.uchicago.edu">Ben</a> to sign up to sell
	them.  Right now, they're saying we'll have them <b>Friday May 8</b>
	(bummer), which is in the midst of the Hunt.  So, plan to sell shirts
	afterwards to recoup the money various parties will therefore be
	pouring into the Roadies and so on.
      </li>
      <li>The mailing list is up and running, as
	<address>potato@listhost.uchicago.edu</address>.  You'll probaby get
	an email about that when it happens.  If Jess doesn't have your email
	address, you'll have to subscribe yourself.  Go to 
	<a href="https://listhost.uchicago.edu/mailman/listinfo/potato"> the
	  listhost server</a> to do that.
      </li>
      <li>We need a few "special people" -- this includes a <i>Prophet
	  Elijah</i>, morning-shift people for the quads, and maybe others.
	Ask an Uber-tater for more information.  Or maybe one of them will
	give me more info to put here.  You never know.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Tech Turnip Michael</b> sayeth:</p

    <p>The survey is about to undergo major updates, because I'm fixing to
      bring a new system online that will track team members and the items
      they are working on.  Watch this space.</p>

    <p>The T-shirt revote is over, and design #5 won by a landslide.  That's
      the three grey boxes with an alma mater stanza.  If you have a pretty
      recent web browser, I've made a sorta mock-up of the design 
      <a href="/grayshirt.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Mad props to Sam for redesigning the website aesthetics.  Wednesday's
      his birthday, so wish him a good one!
    </p>

      Since I'm seeing the question come up from time to time in the survey
      responses, here's the deal with the <b>"Beta Tester"</b> option.  The
      website is going to be rapidly developing over the next week or so as
      I get pieces of the database system working well enough to activate
      them on the site.  Once that starts happening, I need a few people who
      will regularly poke around in the site to report things that (most
      importantly) are broken, or (also nice) could work better or be more
      useful.  This is easier if you have used the database before, but it
      isn't necessary.  Since the goal is for everyone to be able to use the
      database by the time the Hunt starts, computer expertise is
      <i>absolutely not</i> a requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's all for now; I'm going back to real work.
