    <p><b>NEW!</b> Check out the <a href="tips.mhtml"> Dumpster Dive Tip

    <p>We had a meeting Sunday, and we therefore have some actual
      useful information for this site. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>We're going to sell T-shirts for spare moolah.  Complain all
	you want about fundraising, but I think we owe it to the
	road-trippers to feed them.  Maybe we can take a vote
	resolving to spend none of the money raised at Home Depot.
	The shirt is "The Top Five Things to Say When You Drop
	'Critique of Pure Reason' into a Puddle"; email 
	<a href="dclinton@uchicago.edu">Dan</a> to suggest answers to
	this proposition.</li>
      <li>We will be trying to sell these shirts 5th week.  Therefore
	try to have some free time to man a table or something then.
      </li>
      <li>Ben, I think, was supposed to send me a list of things from
	the meeting that were supposed to be posted here.  If he does,
	I might remember more stuff that goes here.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If there's anything else that should go on this site, please
      email it to me and I'll try and get it posted ASAP.  
    </p>

      Since I'm seeing the question come up from time to time in the survey
      responses, here's the deal with the <b>"Beta Tester"</b> option.  The
      website is going to be rapidly developing over the next week or so as I
      get pieces of the database system working well enough to activate them
      on the site.  Once that starts happening, I need a few people who will
      regularly poke around in the site to report things that (most
      importantly) are broken, or (also nice) could work better or be more
      useful.  This is easier if you have used the database before, but it
      isn't necessary.  Since the goal is for everyone to be able to use the
      database by the time the Hunt starts, computer expertise is
      <i>absolutely not</i> a requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      To those of you complaining that the site is ugly: 
    <ol>
      <li>I'm writing code, and I have bad taste in colors anyway.  Check out
	<a href="http://neutrino.webhop.org">some of my prettier work</a> to
	see for yourself.</li> 
      <li>Don't despair.  Sam (a.k.a. <em>His Majesty, Lord Sam Perkins-Harbin
	  of the Elite Scavenging Squad</em>) has offered his elite web design
	skills to beautify the site.  I'll get his changes online soon, but
	the Dumpstering Tips system had priority.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    <p>
      That's all for now; I'm going back to real work.
