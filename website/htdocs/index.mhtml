    <p>If you haven't already done so, <a href="survey.mhtml">go take the
	survey</a>!!!</p>

    <p><b>Tech Turnip Michael</b> sez:</p>

    <p>First things first, if you don't like how I've spelled our Team Name,
      tell me (I've fixed it twice already).  This actually applies to
      anything you don't like about this site.  Second, yeah, this is ugly.
      Post content I've promised people first, make site purty later.  Oh, and
      you guys <i>can</i> email me, you know.  My address is at the bottom of
      the page.  Posting comments about the site in your survey responses just
      means that I don't see it for a day or more.  Email, I read every
      fifteen minutes or so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since I'm seeing the question come up from time to time in the survey
      responses, here's the deal with the <b>"Beta Tester"</b> option.  The
      website is going to be rapidly developing over the next week or so as I
      get pieces of the database system working well enough to activate them
      on the site.  Once that starts happening, I need a few people who will
      regularly poke around in the site to report things that (most
      importantly) are broken, or (also nice) could work better or be more
      useful.  This is easier if you have used the database before, but it
      isn't necessary.  Since the goal is for everyone to be able to use the
      database by the time the Hunt starts, computer expertise is
      <i>absolutely not</i> a requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      To those of you complaining that the site is ugly: 
    <ol>
      <li>I'm writing code, and I have bad taste in colors anyway.  Check out
	<a href="http://neutrino.webhop.org">some of my prettier work</a> to
	see for yourself.</li> 
      <li>If you want to help, why don't you copy this page out of your
	browser and pretty it up.  Post the result somewhere or send it to me,
	and I'll take a look at incorporating your ideas.</li>
      <li>If you do the above, try to avoid fancy hacks.  They don't work in
	all browsers; I don't want to have to work around them when
	(frequently) updating pages; I'm not writing HTML, I'm writing
	programs that spit out HTML, and programs don't cope with fancy hacks
	all that well, especially if the guy writing them doesn't really
	understand the hacks himself.  In short, I probably won't use your
	uber-neato Javascript dynamic rewrite fancification engine.</li>
      <li>Stuff I can use once everywhere, on the other hand, is really
	nifty.  Give me a CSS file that you think looks good, and it's easy
	for me to make all the pages use it.  I'll be happy to give that a
	whirl. </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    <p>
      That's all for now; I'm going back to real work.
