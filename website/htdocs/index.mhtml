    <p>we're <b>revoting</b> the T-shirt!  Email Jess with your preferences;
      see your email for the options.  Vote for up to all five; the one with
      the most total votes wins the vote.

    <p>Mad props to Sam for redesigning the website aesthetics.  Wednesday's
      his birthday, so wish him a good one!

    <p>We had a meeting Sunday, and we therefore have some actual
      useful information for this site. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>We're going to sell T-shirts for spare moolah.  Complain all
	you want about fundraising, but I think we owe it to the road-trippers
	to feed them.  Maybe we can take a vote resolving to spend none of the
	money raised at Home Depot.</li>
      <li>The shirt was going to be "The Top Five Things to Say When You Drop
	'Critique of Pure Reason' into a Puddle", with some foul puns
	answering this proposition.  Now nobody thinks this shirt will sell.
	We might be taking a revote on T-shirts via web poll or email, so keep
	an eye on your email or this space.</li>
      <li>We will be trying to sell these shirts 5th week.  Therefore
	try to have some free time to man a table or something then.  Email 
	<a href="mailto:tbbuckle@cs.uchicago.edu">Ben</a> to sign up.
      </li>
      <li>We also need to put together a road trip team.  To my knowledge,
	there are two slots still open at this time.  Ben says he'll collect
	names of people interested, so email him about that, too.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If there's anything else that should go on this site, please
      email it to me and I'll try and get it posted ASAP.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Since I'm seeing the question come up from time to time in the survey
      responses, here's the deal with the <b>"Beta Tester"</b> option.  The
      website is going to be rapidly developing over the next week or so as
      I get pieces of the database system working well enough to activate
      them on the site.  Once that starts happening, I need a few people who
      will regularly poke around in the site to report things that (most
      importantly) are broken, or (also nice) could work better or be more
      useful.  This is easier if you have used the database before, but it
      isn't necessary.  Since the goal is for everyone to be able to use the
      database by the time the Hunt starts, computer expertise is
      <i>absolutely not</i> a requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's all for now; I'm going back to real work.
