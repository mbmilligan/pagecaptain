    <p>Coming Soon: List Release Day (Wednesday)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meet outside the Burton-Judson dining hall at 6 pm for dinner as a
	group. Some first-years have generously offered many meal points, so
	we will all be able to get in. Thank you to those first-years!</li>
      <li>After dinner, stick around if you can to help with load-in. We need
	some folks with cars to pick up stuff like TVs and food from around
	the neighborhood. We need people with an organizational sense to set
	up Home Base in Upper Burton. And we need people with arms to get all
	of the stuff out from underneath the floor in the black box.</li>
      <li>Around 11 pm, with all of these annoying logistics finally out of the
	way for good (until Sunday), we will begin partying in earnest. Bring
	your CDs (we'll have a stereo), bring your wifebeaters (we'll have 
	markers), bring yourselves (we'll have food). We'll be in Upper
	Burton, where we will stay  for the duration of the Hunt.</li>
      <li>At 11:59, the list is (theoretically) released, and there is no
	planning what happens after that!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The list database is creaking back to life; note the "Last Year's List"
      link in your navigation sidebar.  It'll be getting up to speed
      overnight, so feel free to test it out and make suggestions.  I've
      already gotten a few helpful remarks on it.  But I've got less than a
      day to get the last bits to fall in place, so time is of the essence.
    </p>

    <p>User accounts work now.  Note the login boxes to your right.  If you
      fill out the <a href="<& SELF:base &>survey.mhtml">survey</a>, you can
      get an account, too.  If you've already gotten your password (in your
      email, maybe?), please log in and update your information (again, on
      the survey page). 
    </p>

    <p>Cooler still, now you can see the info for other users, as well.  Just
      log in and you'll see how!  No, really.  Try it!</p>

    <p>Check out the <a href="tips.mhtml"> Dumpster Dive Tip
	Hotline </a> now.  Especially those of you with cars, grocery carts,
      and other means of carting away street treasure.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks to Steve -- he was the first beta tester to notice that I broke
      the website and complain to me.  It's better now.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's all for now; I'm going back to real work.
