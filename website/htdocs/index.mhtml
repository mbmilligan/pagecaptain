    <p>User accounts work now.  Note the login boxes to your right.  If you
      fill out the <a href="<& SELF:base &>survey.mhtml">survey</a>, you can
      get an account, too.  If you've already gotten your information (in your
      email, maybe?), try logging in and updating your information (again, on
      the survey page). 
    </p>

    <p>Cooler still, now you can see the info for other users, as well.  Just
      log in and you'll see how!  No, really.  Try it!

    <p>The ScavHunt 2003 website is up.  Highly recommended reading, if only
      to learn all about the judges.  <a href="http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu">
	See it here </a>.
    </p>

    <p>Email Jess if you want a "Negative Spousal Interaction" shirt purchased
      for you.  The cost will be a small number of dollars, and you'll get
      them probably at our Sunday meeting.
    </p>

    <p>Another reason to bring some money with you to Sunday's meeting: the
      food fund.  Cate will be passing around a menu and the hat on Sunday to
      figure out what food you people would like to have in HQ during the
      Hunt.  Food at SaveALot is cheap, but it ain't free, so be prepared to
      drop a few bucks if you think having a selection of ready-to-eat
      mostly-homemade food in HQ would be a good thing.
    </p>

    <p>It looks like our <i>Prophet Elijah</i> and road trip team have been
      rounded up.  Details will be forthcoming.  If you're still looking for
      something to do, ask around on the list, but keep in mind that we're not
      that big on formal roles.
    </p>

    <p>From the Sunday meeting:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The T-shirt order is has been placed.  You can see the final design
	<a href="/tshirt.pdf">here</a> (black will be printed in gray on a
	maroon background).  Email 
	<a href="mailto:tbbuckle@cs.uchicago.edu">Ben</a> to sign up to sell
	them.  Right now, they're saying we'll have them <b>Friday May 8</b>
	(bummer), which is in the midst of the Hunt.  So, plan to sell shirts
	afterwards to recoup the money various parties will therefore be
	pouring into the Roadies and so on.
      </li>
      <li>The mailing list is up and running, as
	<address>potato@listhost.uchicago.edu</address>.  You'll probaby get
	an email about that when it happens.  If Jess doesn't have your email
	address, you'll have to subscribe yourself.  Go to 
	<a href="https://listhost.uchicago.edu/mailman/listinfo/potato"> the
	  listhost server</a> to do that.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Tech Turnip Michael</b> sayeth:</p

    <p>The survey is about to undergo major updates, because I'm fixing to
      bring a new system online that will track team members and the items
      they are working on.  Watch this space.</p>

    <p>Check out the <a href="tips.mhtml"> Dumpster Dive Tip
	Hotline </a> now.  Especially those of you with cars, grocery carts,
      and other means of carting away street treasure.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks to Steve -- he was the first beta tester to notice that I broke
      the website and complain to me.  It's better now.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's all for now; I'm going back to real work.
