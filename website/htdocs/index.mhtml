<h1>The Database</h1>
<h2>Welcome Back</h2>
</div>

<p>I think we'll use the <a href="<& SELF:base &>../cgi/wiki.pl">Wiki</a> for
    posting news and stuff, but this here is the Database.  Right now it has the
    Virginia Hunt list loaded.
</p>

<p>If you have an account from last year, please log in to update your
    information (I've reset all the passwords to "scavhunt", because I know
    better than to think anyone remembers theirs from a year ago).
</p>

<p>If you <b>don't</b> have an account, take the 
    <a href="<& SELF:base&>survey.mhtml">SURVEY</a> to get one.
</p>
