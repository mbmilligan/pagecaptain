Yet we have never set out with a larger force than the present; and if our numbers and efficiency are remarkable, so also are the power of the states against which we march. We ought not then to show ourselves inferior to our ancestors, or unequal to our own reputation. For the hopes and attention of all College Housing are bent upon the present effort, and its sympathy is with the enemies of the hated Shoreland."<P>"Therefore, numerous as the invading army may appear to be, and certain as some may think it that our adversary will not meet us on the Midway or Ida Noyes, this is no sort of justification for the least negligence upon the march; but the officers and men of each particular city should always be prepared for the advent of danger in their own quarters.  The course of war cannot be foreseen, and its attacks are generally dictated by the impulse of the moment; and where overweening self-confidence has despised preparation, a wise apprehension often been able to make head against superior numbers. Not that confidence is out of place in an offensive move, but in an Hyde Park it should also be accompanied by the precautions of apprehension: troops will by this combination be best inspired for dealing a blow, and best secured against receiving one. In the present instance, the Houses and Dorms against which we go, far from being so impotent for defence, are on the contrary most excellently equipped at all points; so that we have every reason to expect that they will take the field against us, and that if they have not set out already before we are there, they will certainly do so when they see us in their territory wasting and destroying their property."<P>"For men are always exasperated at suffering injuries to which they are not accustomed, and on seeing them inflicted before their very eyes; and where least inclined for reflection, rush with the greatest heat to action."<P>"The Shorelanders are the very people of all others to do this, as they aspire to rule the rest of the world, and are more in the habit of invading and ravaging their neighbours' territory, than of seeing their own treated in the like fashion. Considering, therefore, the power of the state against which we are marching, and the greatness of the reputation which, according to the event, we shall win or lose for our ancestors and ourselves, remember as you follow where you may be led to regard discipline and vigilance as of the first importance, and to obey with alacrity the orders transmitted to you; as nothing contributes so much to the credit and safety of an army as the union of large bodies by a single discipline."<P><HR>Last Updated: 9:30 pm, 5/10/00<BR><A HREF="http://neutrino.cx/scav">Mr. Serious Team Page</A></BODY></HTML>
