    <h2 align="center">Welcome to the Database</h2>
    
    <H3>Useful Links</H3>
    <P><A href="/scavhunt/toc.html">The F.I.S.T. Database Manual</A>. 
      Contact <A href="mailto:scavcat@myrealbox.com">Cate</A> if you have any 
      questions or problems not answered therein.</P>
    <P>Our team's current 
      <A href="getquery.pl?type=catsort&amp;source=query.html&amp;cat=all&amp;sort=points">
	Scav Hunt List</A>.</P> 
    <P>And, of course, the <A href="search.html">Search Page</A>. </P> 
    <P><A href="/scavhunt/index.html">The public ScavHunt page</A>. </P> 

    <P>Oh, and something not database-related: if you read to the end
      of the ScavCom bylaws found on the 
      <A href="http://scavhunt1.uchicago.edu/Hunt02/">Scavhunt home
	page</A> you will find that the "theme song" is "Party Hard"
      by Andrew W.K.  We have an mp3 of this song 
      <A href="Andrew_W.K.-Party_Hard.mp3">here</A>.
    </P> 

    <h3>New Here?</h3>
    <P>Hey!  Welcome to our lil' system.  Here's some things you should
      really, <I>really</I> do if you haven't already -- it'll make things run
      far more smoothly, so we can all concentrate on Scavhunt, not on who's
      doing what:
    <OL>
      <LI><A href="survey.html">Fill out our survey</A> so we know when you're
	available and what cool stuff you can do.</LI>
      <LI><A href="adduser.html">Add yourself to the database</A>.  Then we
	can use our software to track who's doing what and how we're doing.
	Maybe that way no one will call you at 4 am wanting to know if the
	giant catapault is finished.</LI>
      <LI>Consider skimming the <A href="/scavhunt/toc.html">database
	  manual</A> to get an idea of what you can do.</LI>
      <LI><A href="search.html">Go play around in the database</A>.  It's got
	last year's data in it (or will until Wednesday night).</LI>
    </OL>
  </P>
    
    <h3>Logging In</h3> 
    <P>First, log into the database, using your personal database username and 
      password, <A href="relogin.html">here</A>.</P>
    <P>If you don't have a username yet, you can create one for youself 
      <A href="http://neutrino.homeip.net/scav/adduser.html">here</A>. Please
      read the directions below first, though.</P>
    <P>The database user list was accidentally reset partway through ScavHunt
      last year, so if you haven't set your password since then, your password
      is blank.</P>
    
    <H3>Updating Your User Info</H3>
    <P>Please update your user info. Your User Page is the first page you 
      are sent to after you log into the database. If you are already inside 
      the database, you can get to your User Page by going to the 
      <A href="search.html">Search Page</A> and performing a User Search for 
      yourself.</P>
    <P>Once you are at your User Page, you can edit your user info. You need to 
      enter <B>at least</B> a username ("login handle"), one piece of contact 
      information, and a personal password (which needs to be entered twice for 
      verification purposes) in order for the update to go through. If you 
      already have some of these data entered, they will be filled into the 
      form automatically for you. If there is no field for a "login handle" on 
      your User Page, you already have a username, which cannot be changed.</P>
    <P>If your attempt to update your user info does not go through (probably 
      because you have not entered all of the necessary information, as listed 
      above), you will be thrown to the Add User page. Do not fill out this 
      page unless you want to create a new database user account; simply press 
      the Back button in your browser to try updating your user info again.</P>
    <P>Once you have correctly updated your user info, the new version of your 
      User Page will be displayed.</P>
    
    <H3>Using the Database</H3>	
    <P>After you log into the database, you will be presented with your User
      Page, which has a link to the <A href="search.html">Database Search
	Page</A> at the top.  Alternately, you can go there directly from the
      link provided here.</P>
