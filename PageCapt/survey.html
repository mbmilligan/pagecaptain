    <h1> ScavHunt Survey</h1>

    <h2> This is a Very Important Poll (TM).</h2>
    <P> Seriously, folks, we need to have this information sorted out into a 
      database before the Hunt begins. I will hunt you down if you do not 
      write me back. And honest answers only, please.
    </P>

    <P>Thank you,</P>

    <form action="survey.pl" method="GET">

      <P><B>Name</B> <input type="TEXT" name="name" size="70"></P>
      
      <P><B>Major</B> <input type="text" name="major" size="25"></P>
      
      <P><B>Talents</B></P> 
      
      <P>Please list your talents, no matter how bizarre. Can you play the
	kazoo? Stand on your head? Eat large amounts of bacon without
	getting sick? Sew?</P> 
      <textarea name="talents" rows="5" cols="70"></textarea>

      <P><B>Nudity</B></P>
<P>How naked are you willing to get? Down to your underwear? Totally 
topless? Maybe bottomless but not topless?</P>
<P>How public are you willing for that nudity to be? Do we have to provide 
you with pancakes (you provide the syrup flavor of your choice) for your 
nudity to be public?</P>
<textarea name="nudity" rows="2" cols="70"></textarea>

<P><B>Home</B></P>
<P>Where is home? Would your parents be willing to send your childhood toys 
in the mail? (or drive them here?)</P>
<textarea name="home" rows="2" cols="70"></textarea>

<P><B>Meal Points</B></P>
<P>Are you willing to donate 3 meal points to the team so we can get some 
snacklings and some food with which to bribe the judges? (Hint to 
first-years: You are not going to manage to use all of your meal points, 
particularly during Spring Quarter).</P>
<P>If yes, please also enter your ISO number (the long number above the
barcode on your UC ID)</P>
<input type="TEXT" name="points" size="70">

<P><B>Age</B></P>
<P>How old are you?</P>
<input type="TEXT" name="age" size="10">

<P><B>Schedule</B></P>
<P>If you have a general sense of your schedule during Scav Hunt, please 
let us know. Are you totally booked on Thursday afternoon? Free early 
Friday morning?</P>
<textarea name="schedule" rows="5" cols="70"></textarea>
