OVERVIEW

* Import ScavCode-current into CVS on neutrino
* Begin a branch for modularized codebase
* Begin cleanups for this year's Hunt
* Upgrades for this year's hunt:
  -- Minor: add a Helpwanted status tag
  -- Major: revamp categories into keywords system

NEW FEATURES

* Keywords system
  -- Dynamic: user assigns from existing tags or creates new ones
  -- Non-exclusive: associate many tags to each item (e.g. trip AND craft)
  -- Will require a new table (index, tagname)
     + Get tags by SELECT UNIQUE tagname FROM tags
     + Get item's tags by SELECT tagname FROM list JOIN tags WHERE ...

WISHLIST AND CRAZY IDEAS

* List Grid
  -- Navigating the list is troublesome because of its length, so display
     data 2-D color coded for easy navigation
  -- Color code generally used for status, but data can be filtered first
     by keyword, sorted
  -- Since we have 2 dimensions, consider sorting by different properties
     on each axis, e.g. by status and point value, or others
  -- Output as a table; each cell contains just an index number linked
     to the item data page
  -- As always, the defaults will determine how much use this gets
